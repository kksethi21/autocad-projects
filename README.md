Engineering Design Projects

This repository contains practice mechanical parts created in AutoCAD.

Each file includes:
- A 3D model of the mechanical part
- Some files also contain corresponding orthographic views
- Dimension data stored within the DWG files

## Contents
- Multiple mechanical parts with variations in geometry and dimensions
- Files are named using a neutral convention (mechanical_part_XX) to avoid assuming specific part functions

## Software
- AutoCAD

## Notes
- DWG files are the primary source files and contain full modeling and dimension information.
